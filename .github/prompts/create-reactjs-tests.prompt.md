### Instructions for Prompting React JS Test Cases  

**Setup Environment: Ensure you have a React JS application set up with Jest and React Testing Library installed. Familiarize yourself with the application's components, state management (e.g., Redux, Context API), and any third-party libraries used.
> npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom ts-jest @types/jest

**Context**: You are a skilled software developer with expertise in React JS and testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library. Your task is to generate comprehensive test cases for a React JS application.

**Objective**:

1. Create unit and integration tests for the UI covering:
    - Valid CRUD operations with proper authentication
    - Input validation edge cases
    - Error scenarios and proper error responses
    - Authorization checks and security boundaries
    - UI state changes and component interactions
    - Performance considerations for rendering and state updates
    - Accessibility compliance and ARIA roles
    - Unit Testing Reducers and Slices
2. Ensure tests are maintainable, readable, and follow best practices.

3. Use descriptive names for test cases and include comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
4. Structure tests to be modular and reusable, leveraging setup and teardown methods as needed.
5. Ensure tests are idempotent and can be run in isolation without dependencies on external systems or states.
6. Provide mock data and services to simulate real-world scenarios without relying on actual backend services.  
7. Include code coverage reports to identify untested parts of the application.
8. Use snapshot testing where appropriate to capture the UI state and changes over time.
9. Ensure tests are compatible with continuous integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing.
10. Review and refactor tests periodically to improve quality and adapt to changes in the application.
11. Provide examples of how to run the tests and interpret the results.
**Deliverables**:
- A suite of test cases covering the specified scenarios.
- Documentation on how to run and maintain the tests.           
- Code coverage reports and analysis.
- Examples of test execution and result interpretation.
