# Project coding standards for Python
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python.
- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of classes and functions.
- Avoid using global variables; prefer passing parameters and returning values.
- Write unit tests for all functions and ensure they pass before committing code.
- Use meaningful variable names that convey the purpose of the variable.
- Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters for better readability.
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate for cleaner code.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
- Regularly refactor code to improve efficiency and maintainability.
- Use virtual environments to manage project dependencies.
- Document any third-party libraries or frameworks used in the project.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes).
- Avoid deep nesting of code; break down complex functions into smaller, manageable ones.
- Use logging instead of print statements for tracking application flow and debugging.
- Regularly review and update the coding standards as the project evolves.
- Collaborate with team members to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) effectively, with clear commit messages and branching strategies.
- Participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.
- Stay updated with the latest Python features and best practices by following relevant blogs, forums, and official documentation.
- Use type hinting to improve code clarity and facilitate static analysis.
- Ensure that all code is compatible with the project's specified Python version.
- Avoid using wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *) to prevent namespace pollution.
- Use f-strings for string formatting for better performance and readability (Python 3.6+).
- Regularly run linters (e.g., pylint, flake8) to catch potential issues early in the development process.
- Write modular code by breaking down functionality into smaller, reusable functions and classes.
- Ensure that all dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt or equivalent file for easy setup.
